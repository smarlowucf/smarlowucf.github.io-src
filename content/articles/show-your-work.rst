:Summary: Notes from Show Your Work by Austin Kleon

**“Give what you have to someone, it may be better than you dare to
think.” Henry Wadsworth Longfellow**

Always be an amateur
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Don’t be content with mastery, always be a student
-  Find your voice
-  Learn to take a punch and accept criticism
-  Shut up and listen.
-  Be a connector
-  Whatever excites you, go do it

Share something small every day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Share the work and the process
-  Tell good stories
-  Teach what you know
-  Share your trade secrets
-  Contributing something is better than contributing nothing
-  Ask, “So what?” before sharing
-  Don’t overshare

Become a documentation of what you do
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Start a journal
-  Blog
-  Keep your notes

Credit is always due so give attribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  What is it?
-  Who made it?
-  When?
-  Why should we care?
-  How you found it?
-  Where we can find more things like it?

The stories you tell about the work you do have a huge effect on how
people feel and what they understand about your work. This affects how
they value it.
