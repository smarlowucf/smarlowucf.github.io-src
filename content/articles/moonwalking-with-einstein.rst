:Summary: Notes on Moonwalking With Einstein by Joshua Foer

**A memory is a pattern of connections between your neurons.**

Memory Palace or Method of Loci
-------------------------------

Convert something unmemorable into a series of engrossing visual images
and mentally arrange them within an imagined space, and suddenly those
forgettable items become unforgettable.

Use vivid images that stand out for words and objects.

Major System
------------

A simpler way to remember numbers.

PAO (person, action, object)
----------------------------

Faster but more difficult to master. This can be used for numbers and a
deck of cards.
`Wiki <https://artofmemory.com/wiki/Person-Action-Object_(PAO)_System>`__

Every two-digit number from 00 to 99 is represented by a single image of
a person performing an action on an object. Any six-digit number, like
say 34-13-79, can then be turned into a single image by combining the
person from the first number with the action from the second and the
object from the third. Remember unique images. Like Michael jordan
dunking over someone with a basketball and breaking the glass.

##Getting over a learning plateau

If you hit a point of autopilot attempting to get better at something,
force yourself to go 10-20% faster. Note the errors and fix them to get
over the hump.
